# Item storage for early childhood kids

## 📌 Overview
This was my year 12 project for the course product design. I worked with a main client and stakeholders who gave me a problem and certain requirements that they needed for the product to have. For this project, the children had play clothes, shoes and hand puppets that did not have a proper storage space. My client and stakeholder wanted a custom built product to store all these items.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Must be easily accessible to the children
- Easy to clean
- Stable and strong
- Hold 6 hand puppets, 10 dresses and 3 shoes.

## 🛠 Tools & Concepts Used
- Inventor
- Basic carpentry tools and knowledge


## 🔍 Methodology
The first thing I needed to do was gather the requirements from my client and stakeholders. The requirements included :
- Safety for the children i.e. no sharp corners, no splinters, smooth
- Easy accessibility for children to take and put back items
- Hand puppets peg storage to help with fine motor skills
- Strong and sturdy so it would not fall over easily
- Shoe storage area
- Dress storage area
- Easy to clean
- Fit for kids aged 1-5 years old

Prior to finalising the project requirements, I conducted research on existing clothing storage units. Most available designs were intended for adults, and the children’s options identified did not meet the required age specifications. As a result, I drew inspiration from adult storage designs and adapted key features to suit the intended users and functional requirements.Several concept sketches were developed and presented to the client and stakeholders. Following discussion and evaluation, a final design was agreed upon. <br>

After completing the design phase, I began the construction process in the workshop. MDF was selected as the primary material due to its smooth surface finish, ease of machining, and reduced risk of splintering compared to solid timber, making it more suitable for a child-friendly environment. Some of those tools used in the construction process were : <br>

- Drill press
- Belt sander
- Jigsaw
- Drills
- Screwdrivers
- Sandpaper
- Router
<br>

Some of the tools used during construction were new to me, which provided an opportunity to develop additional practical skills throughout the build process. All components were assembled using wood glue and countersunk screws to ensure strong and secure joints.<br>

During construction, I identified a potential design improvement. The shoe storage compartment had been fabricated as a separate unit, with additional components attached above it. In hindsight, integrating the shoe storage directly into the side panels would have reduced material usage and simplified assembly. Due to the stage of construction, redesigning the component was not feasible without significant rework. The existing design was therefore completed as planned, with all joints reinforced using glue and screws. <br>

Following assembly, the unit was sanded thoroughly to remove sharp edges and achieve a smooth finish before delivery to the childcare centre.

## 📊 Results
- The storage item worked perfectly
- The size of the whole item was perfect for the kids in the childcare
- All puppets, clothes and shoes fit well
- client and stakeholder were happy with rounded edges and corners
- Children showed interest and could easily take and put back items held by the storage item

## 📸 Project Images
Unfortunately, this project took place a long time ago and I no longer have the images of the design and construction process and only of the completed item.

## 📚 What I Learned
- The importance of effectively communicating with clients and stakeholders, and translating their requirements into practical design decisions.
- Increased proficiency in the use of workshop tools, as well as a better understanding of material behaviour during fabrication.
- The cost and time required to correct design issues increases significantly as a project progresses.
- The importance of identifying and resolving potential design flaws early in the planning phase, particularly before material fabrication begins.
